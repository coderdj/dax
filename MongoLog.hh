/* 
   A brief treatise on log priorities. 

   LOCAL: the debuggiest debug messages possible. Only written to 
   local file and not uploaded to the database. Nobody will ever
   want to read these except you in the next 5 minutes and maybe 
   not even you. The default running mode does not record these at all.

   DEBUG: Actual debug stuff that you may want to leave on during
   commissioning. Will be uploaded to the DB. A very good idea would
   be to configure a TTL index (or some similar functionality) on 
   messages containing this priority so they get deleted after, say, 
   a month. Then just leave on forever.

   WARNING: little oops. Bad thing happened but it is concievable 
   the DAQ will continue without intervention if it just auto restarts. 
   An example would be if you try to start with a run mode this process
   cannot find.

   ERROR: big oops. The DAQ will not recover from this without manual
   intervention. An example would be like a disk full error or something
   along those lines.

   FATAL: reserved for something to write out right before crashing and 
   dying. Like a last gasp before giving up the ghost. These are the words
   on your process' tombstone. An operator shouldn't expect to find a running
   *process.
